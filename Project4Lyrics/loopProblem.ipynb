Im sorry son!\" \"Shut up you cunt!\" I said \"Fuck it!\" Took it and stuck it back up in my head Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neckBrain damage, ever since the day I was born Drugs is what they used to say I was on They say I never knew which way I was goin But everywhere I go they keep playin my song Brain damage, ever since the day I was born Drugs is what they used to say I was on They say I never knew which way I was goin But everywhere I go they keep playin my song Brain damage Its brain damage I got brain damage Its brain damage Its probably brain damage Its brain damage Brain damage I got brain damage  \n",
       "5   And everyone should get along Okay children, quiet down, quiet down Children, Id like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day His name is Mr. Shady Chidren, quiet down please Brian, dont throw that (shut up) Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with Pneumonia (hes got AIDS) Good luck Mr. Shady Hi there, little boys and girls (fuck you)Today were going to learn how to poison squirrels But first Id like you to meet my friend Bob (huh?) Say hi, Bob Hi Bob Bobs 30 and still lives with his mom He dont got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot But his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock When its late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog Drags them into the woods and goes straight to the chopping block And even if they escaped and they got the cops The ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge Til one night Mrs. Stacy went off the job When she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk But Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it off But Bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker Crazier than Slim Shady when hesoff the vodka You couldnt even take him to Dres to get Bob a doctor Grabbed Stace by the legs as he chopped them off her And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her But ever since the day Stacy went off to wander they never found her And Bob still hangs at the waffle diner And thats the story of Bob and his marijuana And what it might do to you So see if the squirrels want any, its bad for you See children, drugs are bad (come on)And if you dont believe me ask your dad (raise your hand)And if you dont believe him ask your mom (thats right) Shell tell you how she does them all the time (she will) So kids say no to drugs (thats right) So you dont act like everyone else does (uh huh) And theres really nothing else to say (sing along) Drugs are just bad, mkay? My penis is the size of a peanutHave you seen it? Fuck no you aint seen itIt the size of a peanut (huh?) Speaking of peanuts You know what else is bad for squirrels? Ectasy, its the worst drug in the world If someone ever offers it to you, dont do it Kids, two hitsll probably drain all your spinal fluid And spinal fluid is final, you wont get it back So dont get attatched itll attack every bone in your back Meet Zach, 21 years old After hanging out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold And decides to try five when hes bribed by five guys And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it Suddenly, he starts to convulse And his pulse goes into hyperdrive And his eyes roll back in his skull His back starts to, look like the McDonalds arches Hes on Donalds carpet Laying horizontal barfin And everyone in the apartment starts laughing at him \"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him.\" Cause they took it too, so they think its funny So theyre laughing at basically nothing Except maybe wasting their money Meanwhile Zachs in a coma The action is over, and his back and his shoulders hunched up like hes practicing yoga And thats the story of Zach: The Ecstasy maniac So, dont even feed that to squirrels, class, cause its bad for you See children, drugs are bad (thats right)And if you dont believe me ask your dad (thats right) And if you dont believe him ask your mom (you can) Shell tell you how she does them all the time (she will)So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack) So you dont act like everyone else does (thats right) And theres really nothing else to say (uh huh) Drugs are just bad, mkay? And last but not leastOne of the most humongous Problems among young people today is fungus It grows from cow manure They pick it out, wipe if off, bag it upAnd you put it right in your mouth and chew it Yum, yum And then you start to see some dumb stuff And everything slows down when you eat some of em And sometimes you see things that arent there (like what?) Like fat women in g-strings with orange hair Mr. Shady, whats a g-string? Its yarn Clair, women stick them up their behinds go out and wear them And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus Your tounge gets All swolled up, like a cows tongue (How come?) Cause it comes from a cows dung See drugs are bad, its a common fact But your mom and dad know Thats all that Im good at But dont be me Cause if you grow up and go and OD Theyre gonna come for me, and Im gonna have to grow a goatee And get a disguise and hide Cause itll be my fault So dont drugs and do exactly as I dont, because Im bad for you See children, drugs are bad (uh huh)And if you dont believe me ask your dad (put that down) And if you dont believe him ask your mom (you can ask) Shell tell you how she does them all the time (and she will) So kids say no to drugs (say no) So you dont act like everyone else does (like I do)And theres really nothing else to say (thats right) Drugs are just bad, mkay?

A picture of my big white ass Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help Here, XXL, XXL Now your magazine shouldnt have so much trouble to sell Fuck it, Ill even buy a couple myself Cuz Im, just Marshall Mathers, Im just a regular guy I dont know why all the fuss about me Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me Cuz Im, just Marshall Mathers, Im just a regular guy I dont know why all the fuss about me Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me  \n",

       "\"If I could rewind time like a tape, Inside a boombox, One day for every pill, Or percocet that I ate, Cut down on the valium, That'll hurt everything, But death is turning so definite, wait, They got me all hooked up to some machine, I love you, Bean, Didn't want you to know I was struggling, Feels like I'm underwater, Submerged like a submarine, Just heard that nurse say, My liver and kidneys aren't functioning, Been flirtatious with death, Skirt-chasing, I guess, It's arrivederci, Same nurse, just heard say, They're unplugging me, And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday, Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai, And sweeties, thank you for waiting, To open gifts, But, girls, you can just open 'em, Dad ain't making it home for Christmas, Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss, I go to make a fist, But I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff, I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout, My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not allowed, You put your arm around mama, The karma, wow, I just thought about the aisle, I'll never get to walk us down, Never see you, Graduate in your caps and gowns, It's 'bout to be 2008, How's this happening now?, I've got so much more to do, And prove, I'm truly sorry, If I let you down, but this tore me in two, The thought of no more me and you, You gave me shoes, Nikes like new, For me for school, Doody, I'm trying, but you, You were the glue that binded, So many things, time, I'd give anything to rewind it, I had to walk down my halls, And constantly be reminded, By pictures all on my walls, And I couldn't sleep at night 'cause, That image burned in my brain, Of you on the table, Me falling across your body, Not able to stand to save you, God, why did you take him?, I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, But I'm dying, where's Nathan?, Little ladies, be brave, Take care of your mother, Smile pretty for pictures, Always cherish each other, I'll always love ya, And I'll be in the back of your memory, And I know you'll never forget me, Just don't get sad when remembering, And, little bro, keep making me proud, You better marry that girl, 'Cause she's faithfully down, And when you're exchanging those sacred vows, Just know that if I could be there, I would, And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it, Oh, almost forgot to do something, Thank my father too, I actually learnt a lot from you, You taught me what not to do, And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance, To have one last heart-to-heart, Honest and open talk to you, Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you, And I can feel my soul leave my body, And float across the room, Nurses lean over the bed, Pulling tubes out, Then the sheet over my head, Shut the room down, Girls, please don't get upset, I see those cheeks soaking and wet, As you squeeze hold of my neck, So forcibly, don't wanna let, Me go, pillow drenched, Emotional wrecks, With every second, Each closer to death, But suddenly, I feel my heart, Begin to beat slow, then a breath, Machines go (beep, beep, beep), Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit, I'm tryna rewind time like a tape, Find an escape, Make a beeline, Try and awake, From this dream, I need to re-find, My inner strength, To remind me, Even if a steep climb I must take, To rewrite a mistake, \""
