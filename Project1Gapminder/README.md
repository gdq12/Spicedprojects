Gapminder Project (week1)
-------------------------

The purpose of this project was to replicate the gif graph present by Hans Rosling in his 2010 TED talk. Data sets on life expectancy, fertility and population were taken from the gapminder site and used to determine the correlation between life expectancy and fertility in the time period of 1960-2015. Throughout this time period, there was a correlation between the increase of life expectancy and decrease in fertility rate. Also, the analysis shows heavily populated countries followed the trend of this correlation, starting at low life expectancy/high fertility rate at 1960 and ending with high life expectancy/low fertility rate by 2015.
