The purpose of this project was to web scrape song lyrics from any 2 artist and attempt to build a machine learning algorithm with the capacity to distinguish the author (either of the 2 artist used to build the model) of a group of text. At the moment, model evaluation has been fine tuned suing in particular learning curves to evaluate how well the model fits to the data. The project will be returned to at a future date to fine tune data exploration and word vectorization.
