If not himself then he has naught To say the things he truly feels And not the words of one who kneels The record shows I took the blows And did it my way Yes, it was my way "

And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two. And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid like: ""I love you.""

16,"Writer s : leo robin/ralph rainger Thanks for the memory Of things I can t forget Journeys on a jet Our wond rous week in martinique And vegas and roulette How lucky I was And thanks for the memory Of summers by the sea Dawn in waikiki We had a pad in london But we didn t stop for tea How cozy it was Now since our breakup I wake up Alone on a gray morning-after I long for the sound of your laughter And then I see the laugh s on me But thanks for the memory Of every touch a thrill I ve been through the mill I ve lived a lot and learned a lot You loved me not and still I miss you so much Thanks for the memory Of how we used to jog Even in a fog That barbecue in malibu Away from all the smog How rainy it was Thanks for the memory Of letters I destroyed Books that we enjoyed Tonight the way things look I need a book by sigmund freud How brainy he was Gone are those evenings on broadway Together we d go to a great show But now I begin with the late show And wish that you Were watching, too I know it s a fallacy That grown men never cry Baby, that s a lie We had our bed of roses But forgot that roses die And thank you so much "

18,"If you go away on this summer day, Then you might as well take the sun away; All the birds that flew in the summer sky, When our love was new and our hearts were high; When the day was young and the night was long, And the moon stood still for the night bird s song. If you go away, if you go away, if you go away. But if you stay, I ll make you a day Like no day has been, or will be again; We ll sail the sun, we ll ride on the rain, We ll talk to the trees and worship the wind. Then if you go, I ll understand, Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand, If you go away, if you go away, if you go away. If you go, as I know you will, you must tell the world to stop turning Till you return again, if you ever do, for what good is love without loving you, Can I tell you now, as you turn to go, I ll be dying slowly till the next hello, If you go away, if you go away, if you go away. But if you stay, I ll make you a night Like no night has been, or will be again. I ll sail on your smile, I ll ride on your touch, I ll talk to your eyes that I love so much. But if you go, go, I won t cry, Though the good is gone from the word goodbye, If you go away, if you go away, if you go away. If you go away, as I know you must, There ll be nothing left in the world to trust, Just an empty room, full of empty space, Like the empty look I see on your face. I d have been the shadow of your shadow If I thought it might have kept me by your side. If you go away, if you go away, if you go away. "

20,"Strangers in the night exchanging glances Wondering in the night What were the chances we d be sharing love Before the night was through. Something in your eyes was so inviting Something in your smile was so exciting Something in my heart Told me I must have you. Strangers in the night Two lonely people we were strangers in the night Up to the moment When we said our first hello. Little bit we know Love was just a glance away A warm embracing dance away, and Ever since that night we ve been together. Lovers at first sight, in love forever. It turned out so right For strangers in the night. Love was just a glance away A warm embracing dance away. Ever since that night we ve been together. Lovers at first sight, in love forever. It turned out so right For strangers in the night. "

23,"Writer s : Antonion Carlos Jobim  Sad is to live in solitude far from your tranquil altitude Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream that never can be, will never be dreamer awake, wake up and see.

33,"Unfortunately, we are not authorized to show these lyrics "
34,"Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you If you re young at heart. For it s hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind If you re young at heart. You can go to extremes with impossible schemes. You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams. And life gets more exciting with each passing day. And love is either in your heart, or on it s way. Don t you know that it s worth every treasure on earth To be young at heart. For as rich as you are, it s much better by far To be young at heart. And if you should survive to 105, Look at all you ll derive out of being alive! And here is the best part, you have a head start If you are among the very young at heart. And if you should survive to 105, Look at all you ll derive out of being alive! And here is the best part, you have a head start If you are among the very young at heart. "
35,"Love is a many-splendored thing, It s the April rose that only grows in the early spring, Love is nature s way of giving a reason to be living, The golden crown that makes a man a king. Lost on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist two lovers kissed and the world stood still, When our fingers touch my silent heart has taught us how to sing, Yes, true love s a many-splendored thing. "

Only a fool would say But if you ll let me love you It s for sure I m gonna love you all the way, all the way So if you let me love you It s for sure I m gonna love you all the way, all the way "
37,"Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom When the jungle shadows fall Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock As it stands against the wall Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops When the summer shower is through So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you Night and day You are the one Only you beneath the moon and under the sun Whether near to me or far It s no matter, darling, where you are I think of you Day and night Night and day Why is it so That this longing for you follows wherever I go? In the roarin  traffic s boom In the silence of my lonely room I think of you Day and night Night and day Under the hide of me There s an oh such a hungry yearnin  burnin  inside of me And its torment won t be through  Til you let me spend my life making love to you Day and night Night and day Night and day You are one Only you  neath the moon or under the sun Whether near to me or far It s no matter, baby, where you are I think of you Day and night Night and day Why is it so That this longing for you follows wherever I go In the roarin  traffic s boom In the silence of my lonely room I think of you Day and night Night and day Under the height of me There s an oh such a hungry yearnin  burnin  inside of me And its torment won t be through  Til you let me spend life making love to you Day and night Night and day "

Some like the boptype refrain, I m sure that if, I heard even one riff, It would bore me terrifically, too, Yet I get a kick out of you.

56,"Granada, I m falling under your spell, And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell. Of an age the world has long forgotten, Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today. The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada. For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada. It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along, Entranced by the beauty before me, Entranced by a land full of flowers and song. When day is done and the sun touch the sea in Granada, I envy the blush of the snow-clad Tierra Novada, Soon it will welcome the stars While a thousand guitars play a soft Carbinera. Then moonlit Granada will live again, The glory of yesterday, romantic and gay.  musical interlude  And soon it will welcome the stars While a thousand guitars play a soft Carbinera.
