The goal of this week's project is to understand Time Series analysis and the time dependence on time series data. The data used for this analysis was acquired with explicit permission from the [European Climate Assessment & Dataset](https://www.ecad.eu/). Thus far time series analysis has been conducted with Auto regression (AR), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api) an sklearn based module created by facebook. Still need to conduct model reconstruction and analysis cleanup, which will be returned to at a later date.
